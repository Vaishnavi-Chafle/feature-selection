# Feature Selection in Machine Learning

This repository contains notebooks demonstrating major feature selection techniques:

## 🗂️ Folders
- **filter-based** — statistical filter methods  
- **wrapper-based** — wrapper methods like RFE  
- **embedded-based** — feature selection built into learning algorithms  
- **hybrid** — combinations of methods

Each folder contains:
1. A README explaining the technique
2. A Notebook with code
